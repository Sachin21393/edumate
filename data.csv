1,Ellie the Elephant Learns to Share,"Ellie was a sweet little elephant who lived in a vast green forest. She had everything she could ever want, but she always felt something was missing in her life. One day, she noticed a family of rabbits who had lost their home in a storm. They looked scared and were huddled together under a tall tree, shivering in the cold.

Feeling kind-hearted, Ellie offered to let them stay in her cozy home with her. At first, she loved having them around, but as time went by, she started feeling irritated that they took up so much space and time, and she couldnât enjoy her usual activities. Ellie began to feel resentful and kept telling herself that they should leave.

One morning, Ellie woke up, and to her surprise, the rabbits had all gone. She looked around and felt a twinge of sadness in her heart. The forest was empty and quiet, and she realized that the rabbits had made her life so much more interesting and joyful. She realized that her happiness came from helping others and sharing her resources, not from keeping them all to herself.

From that day, Ellie made a promise to herself that she would always help those in need and share what she had, and she knew that doing so would eventually bring her true happiness. Ellie had learned a valuable lesson that sharing her space and love would create even more happiness for her and everyone around her.",./images/Ellie the Elephant Learns to Share.png
2,The Magical Watermelon,"Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a kind and generous farmer named Jack. Jack was known for his enormous watermelons, which were always the sweetest and juiciest ones in town. One day, Jack received a magical seed, which grew into a watermelon much bigger than any he had ever seen before.

Jack decided to share his prized possession with the whole village, but he wanted to make sure that everyone followed his one rule: everyone could have a slice of the watermelon, but they had to share it with someone else. Unfortunately, some villagers did not follow Jackâs rule and kept the whole watermelon for themselves. They soon discovered that, unlike Jackâs usual watermelons, this one was sour and unripe.

The villagers who had shared the watermelon with someone else, however, discovered that it tasted even sweeter than Jackâs usual watermelons. Jack told them that the magic of the watermelon only worked when it was shared with others. From that day on, the villagers learned to appreciate the joy of sharing and the importance of being kind to one another.

The moral of the story is that sharing is not only important, but it also brings joy and happiness to everyone. No matter how big or small a gift is, it is always worth sharing with others. Remember to be kind and selfless like Jack, and you will find that your life will be much sweeter and more fulfilling.",./images/The Magical Watermelon.png
