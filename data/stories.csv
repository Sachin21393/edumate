1,The Amazing Train Adventure,"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between two mountains, there was a train station where many trains chugged up and down the tracks. The trains carried passengers, goods, and sometimes even farm animals. However, one train stood out from the rest - a sleek, shiny train that everyone admired. The train's name was Speedy, and he loved nothing more than racing across the tracks at breakneck speed.

One day, Speedy was racing past a farm when he saw a group of animals crossing the tracks. Ignoring the warning signals and the frantic shouts of the conductor, Speedy continued along his path. Suddenly, he hit a cow that had strayed too far from the group. Speedy and the cow were badly damaged, and the passengers and crew were injured.

As it happened, Helpy, a slower train that had stopped at the farm, witnessed the accident. Helpy realized that Speedy had been too reckless and was now paying the consequences. Taking his own slow and careful approach, Helpy managed to guide the injured animals and the other trains on their journeys. Though he wasn't as fast or flashy as Speedy, Helpy proved that being careful and considerate was just as important as speed. 

From then on, Speedy learned from his mistake and made sure to always keep his eyes open for any potential dangers on the tracks. He also understood that helping others was more important than being the fastest. The other trains respected Speedy for the humility he showed in learning from his mistake, and they all worked together to make sure that everyone and everything arrived safely at their destinations. 

Moral of the story: It's not how fast you go that matters, but how you behave along the way. Sometimes it's important to slow down and be patient, and sometimes it's even more important to help others in need.",http://127.0.0.1:5000/images/The Amazing Train Adventure.png
2,The Little Dinosaur's Lesson,"Once upon a time, in a land far away from here, there was a little dinosaur named Rex. He loved exploring his home, but he never liked to listen to his parents. They often told him to be careful and stay near, but he always wanted to wander off on his own. One day, he came across a stagnant pond and decided to take a sip. However, he soon realized that the water was contaminated and made him very sick.

Lying on the ground, feeling weak and helpless, Rex realized that he should have listened to his parents. They knew what was best for him, and he should have followed their guidance. From that day on, Rex promised himself to always listen to his parents and never wander off on his own again. He learned a valuable lesson that sometimes, others who have more experience and knowledge might know what's best for him.

The next day, Rex's parents reminded him of his past foolishness and how he nearly harmed himself. They were happy to see that he had learned his lesson and promised to always listen to them. Rex was grateful for his loving family and how they always had his best interests in mind, even if he didn't realize it at first.

In the end, Rex's sickness only lasted for a few days, but the lesson he learned stayed with him for a lifetime. He learned that it's important to listen to the advice of others and never wander off on his own. He knew that his parents loved him and wanted him to stay safe, so he always followed their guidance from that day on.",http://127.0.0.1:5000/images/The Little Dinosaur's Lesson.png
3,The Monkey Family,"In a dense jungle, there lived a family of monkeys. Father monkey was very strict and always warned the little monkeys about the dangers of the jungle. But the little monkeys always thought that they were smarter than the father monkey and did not take his warnings seriously.

One day, the little monkeys went out to play and came across a hive of bees. They thought to themselves that they could easily get the honey without getting stung. So, they climbed up the tree and started hitting the hive with a stick. Suddenly, they heard a loud buzzing sound, and the bees started attacking them. They ran back to their father monkey for help.

The father monkey comforted them and said, ""I always want the best for you, my little monkeys. But sometimes, you need to trust me and listen to my advice. When you ignore my warnings, you will face the consequences of your actions. Remember, a good listener can surpass even the smartest monkey."" From that day, the little monkeys started respecting their father's advice and became more responsible in their actions.",http://127.0.0.1:5000/images/The Monkey Family.png
4,The Adventures of Orange ,"Orange was a very happy fruit that lived in a basket in the farmerâs market. One day, a group of children passed by and noticed how bright and beautiful Orange looked. They instantly fell in love with Orange and begged their parents to buy it for them. The farmer saw how excited the children were and decided to sell Orange to them. 

Excited to taste Orange, the children took it to their backyard and began to cut it up. Suddenly, they realized that it was not ripe yet and not as sweet as they thought it would be. They were very disappointed and felt like they had wasted their money on something they didn't even enjoy. 

This experience taught the children a valuable lesson. They learned that just because something looks attractive from the outside, it might not necessarily be good on the inside. They promised to be more patient and wait for things to fully mature before making a decision. From then on, they appreciated Orangeâs beauty and waited patiently for it to be ripe before eating it, savoring every sweet bite. 

Moral: Just like Orange, we should not judge things by their appearance. It is important to look deeper and wait for things to fully mature before making a decision. Patience and positivity lead to better experiences and outcomes.",http://127.0.0.1:5000/images/The Adventures of Orange .png
